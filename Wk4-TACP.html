        <h2>Advantages of Deep-Level Diversity</h2>
        <p>This is for the course project Week 4 Team Assignment: Course Project - Organizing Teams from MGMT211 Management Foundations. The goal of this project is to display the advantages of deep-level diversity in a team on a poster, which can be seen in the appendix. In designing this poster, the first thing that needs to be done is to identify what the advantages of deep-level diversity are. Within the course book <em>MGMT12e</em> by Chuck Williams, there are several factors that play into deep-level diversity (Williams, 2019):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Disposition and Personally: how one behaves, displays emotions, and reacts.</li>
            <li>Extraversion: the activity/interactivity and sociability of a person (the opposite would be introverts).</li>
            <li>Emotional stability: determines one's ability to react.</li>
            <li>Agreeableness: the ability of flexibility and cooperation.</li>
            <li>Conscientiousness: one’s work ethic.</li>
            <li>Openness: ability to be broadminded and ability to discover alternatives.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>For this project, the primary goal was to showcase the benefits of deep-level diversity in a poster. I decided to format the poster to be able to be printed on common letter paper, leaving a spacious margin for A4 paper so that it could be displayed easily. The software that was used for the development of this poster is called Photopea, a Photoshop-replicated website to develop this poster. In the development of the poster, I took the factors above and divided them into four categories. These categories are creativity, problem-solving, innovation, and decision-making; all of these being factors that are associated with the described factors of deep-level diversity. In a further analysis, I created a simple polygon logo that represents each category, and within these categories, two sections were established. The first category is associated with the left side which represents qualities. The second category, on the right side, represents the effects that the category has. Moving on to other details, the poster is topped with a curved title of “Unlocking the Power of Deep-Level Diversity” to represent flexibility and finished off with a call to action to learn more and a resource that directs to this page via a QR code &lpar;<a href="https://samuel-kinaitis.github.io/MGMT211/Wk4-TACP">https://samuel-kinaitis.github.io/MGMT211/Wk4-TACP</a>&rpar;. In addition, there is a small logo in the bottom left corner that represents a company logo for identification and personalization.</p>
    <p>Overall this poster displays the qualities of deep-level diversity in the categories of creativity, problem-solving, innovation, and decision-making. It goes into further detail to display attributes and benefits from each category. Lastly, the poster concludes with a dedicated call to action section, providing guidance for individuals seeking more information about deep-level diversity.</p>
